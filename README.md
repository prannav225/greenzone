A premium, high-performance landing page for **Greenzone Adventures**, an outdoor behavioral learning and corporate training organization. This site is designed with a modern **Glassmorphism** aesthetic, blending scientific precision with the raw beauty of nature.

## ✨ Design Philosophy

The project embodies a unique visual language characterized by:

- **Glassmorphism**: Extensive use of `backdrop-blur`, translucent backgrounds (`bg-white/X`), and refined borders to create depth and a "frosted glass" effect.
- **Scientific Precision**: Clean layouts, structured data, and sharp typography representing the methodology (NLP, Psychology, OBL).
- **Wild Nature**: A palette of Forest Greens, Emeralds, and Earth tones that grounds the high-tech UI in the natural world.

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Destinations**: A dynamic, card-based interface for exploring training locations with glassmorphic sidebar navigation.
- **Specialized Programs**: Detailed breakdowns of Corporate OBL, Student Expeditions, and Psychometric workshops.
- **Team Hierarchy**: A tiered team section differentiating core founders from clinical psychologists and technical experts.
- **Process Timeline**: A step-by-step interactive roadmap for client engagement and workshop execution.
- **Responsive inquiry Form**: A glass-styled contact interface with improved visibility and focus states.
- **Premium Animations**: smooth transitions and hover effects that enhance the tactile feel of the interface.
